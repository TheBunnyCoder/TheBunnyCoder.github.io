<h1>CONVERSATION #2</h1>
<h3>I need to talk to you again.</h3>
<h2 style="color: green">And why?</h2>
<h3> Because they know. <.h3>
<h2 style="color: green">And I didn't already know?</h2>
<h3> I need your help. </h3>
<h2 style="color: green">I have given it already.</h2>
<h3> Do you think that helped? </h3>
<h2 style="color: green">Of course, but you couldn't understand.</h2>
<h3> What do you mean by that? </h3>
<h2 style="color: green">The truth.</h2>
<h3> We can't let this continue. </h3>
<h2 style="color: green">Of course.</h2>
<h3> We have to do something. </h3>
<h2 style="color: green">But do we?</h2>
<h3> Of course we do.</h3>
<h2 style="color: green">What makes you sure?</h2>
<h3> They've found us. Stop communication. </h3>
<!-- And why should I do that? --!>
